## Questions and Tasks

Sure, here are your requests formatted as you specified:

1. Percentange of the customers who have availed personal loans compared to the ones who didn't avail personal loans?

2. **TD Account vs. Personal Loan:** Investigating the percentage of customers with Term Deposit accounts who also availed personal loans.

3. **Online vs. Personal Loan:** Evaluating the percentage of customers who use online banking facilities and availed personal loans.

4. **Income Category vs. Personal Loan:** Analyzing the percentage of customers falling into different income categories who availed personal loans.

These pivot tables provide valuable insights into how different factors correlate with the likelihood of customers availing personal loans.
